IDS 706: Mini Project 4
Github Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions
Kayla Haeussler

The purpose of this assignment was to set up a Github actions workflow which will test across at least 3 different Python versions.
For this assignment, I used my previous Pandas descriptive statistics repository, mini project 2, as a template, and then added the following to the ```hello.yml``` in out github workflows:


# Assignment Requirements
- Set up a Gitlab Actions workflow
- Test across at least 3 different Python versions



# Data Set Used in this Project
The data set used in this project, StudentPerformanceFactors.csv, was pulled from kaggle.com, a website offering public domain data sets. This data is described as a "comprehensive overview of various factors affecting student performance in exams", including data for 6,607 students's grade on a final exam as well as information on various factors that may affect their exam performance, such as # of hours studied, percentage of classes attended, parental involvement (Low, Medium, High), and many others.

# Example Summary Statistics
Example output generated by the get_summary_stats function in main when the column of interest is "Exam_Score"
